## Welcome to my Time Series Forecasting Project

The aim of the project is to create accurate forecasts of the time series for resource comsumption in office buildings at the National University of Singapore.

For this purpose, I will be exploring the use of **recurrent neural networks**.

I hope you will find the material in this GitHub pages useful. 

Thank you for your reading time.
