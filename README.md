## Welcome to my Time Series Forecasting Project

The aim of the project is to create accurate forecasts of electrial resource consumption in office buildings at the National University of Singapore.

For this purpose, I will be exploring the use of **recurrent neural networks**.

I hope you will find the material in this GitHub pages useful. 

Thank you for your reading time.
